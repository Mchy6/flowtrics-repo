Document automation is essential in today’s companies because it can significantly improve efficiency, productivity, accuracy, compliance, and customer satisfaction while reducing costs and errors associated with manual document creation and management.
What is document automation?
Document automation is the process of using technology to create, manage, and produce documents automatically. This technology allows organizations to streamline their document creation processes, reducing the time and resources required to create, review, approve, and distribute documents.
Document automation tools typically include features such as pre-defined templates, rules and logic for document generation, data integration with other software systems, and the ability to automatically populate fields with data from external sources.
Document automation can be used to create a variety of documents, such as contracts, proposals, invoices, and reports. It can be used across many industries, including legal, finance, healthcare, HR, higher education, and government, to improve efficiency, accuracy, and productivity while reducing costs and errors.  Flowtrics is a company that focuses on making your document automation simple and easy. The following are some ways to implement Document Automation in your company.
