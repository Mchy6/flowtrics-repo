Administration, Social Services, Admissions, New Employee Onboarding and HR, Medical Records, DON, and Dietary all have a need for Flowtrics workflows.
Without Flowtrics Engage for Admissions and Discharging:
Paper and PDF Forms create problematic manual processes.
Resident Admissions processes are paper and require a significant amount of time to highlight and tag every location to fill out and sign.  Then they have to print two sets and ensure everything is signed and the Residents family receives a copy.  Everything is manual and, according to research, doesn’t get signed and stored correctly 60% of the time.  This is a huge liability and a time-consuming process for the admissions employees that could be doing more practical tasks with their time.
Flowtrics helps Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNF) automate Workflows using its AI to read documents, extract, and analyze data to automate, create, and complete task-flows, contracts, forms, eSignatures, documents and integrates essential data to other systems to improve compliance and empower your SNF to automate workflows.

ADMISSIONS, HR AND ALL DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE SNF HAVE MANUAL PAPERWORK PROCESSES.
Admissions is a form intensive process.  Admissions docs need to be signed by the Resident or the Family.  Takes admissions 2 hours per new Resident to print 2 packages, mark and highlight everywhere that needs to be filled with an e-signature.  The paper is expensive and the time is expensive when Admissions could be doing a lot of other things.  In addition, storage costs are an additional expense.  Then the process starts all over again when you go to discharge the resident from the facility.
